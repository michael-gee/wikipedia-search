# wikipedia-search
Wikipedia Search Application that takes a user search input and returns list of related wikipedia pages.

If user types in "random" in the searchbar, it will retrieve a Wikiepedia page selected at random and return related articles from the searched word "random".

I used HTML/CSS/Javascript/jQuery in this project along with Google Fonts and Font-Awesome Icons CDN.
